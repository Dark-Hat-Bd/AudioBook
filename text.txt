a winter monring is misty and cold.
There is dense fog everywhere.
Sometimes the fog is so dense that the sun rays can no get through it.
Even things at a little distance can hardly be seen.
Bird's chirpping is not heard. 
The cow and other animals can not come out.
But it is not so every morning.
Dew drops fall on leaves and blades of brass at night.
the look like glittering pearls when the rays of the morning sun fall on them.
Village children and people have hardly warm cloths.
They gather straw and dry leaves to make fire to warm themselves. 
The old and the poor bask in the sun in order to warm themselves.
People in general and children get up late.
So everyone is busy in taking breakfast ,
dressing and getting ready for going to their respective place.
in a winter mornign one can enjoy delicious and sweet cakes,payesh of date juice and many other things . 
the scene of the winter morning vanishes as the day advances.
the sun goes up and the fog melts.
A winter morning is enjoyable in many respects.
